# Responsive_website
I created this website using Flexbox and Grid for positioning and media queries for responsiveness to practice my frontend skills. 

Disclamer: I used absolute length units (px) most of the time just to try to have more precision of the website I was trying to emulate. In a real life example, for more responsiveness we should use relative units (rem, for example).
